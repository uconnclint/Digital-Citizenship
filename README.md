# Digital Citizenship: Glitches in Digital City

## Overview
"Glitches in Digital City" is a 90's Sierra-inspired point-and-click adventure designed for 3rd graders. Players explore a neon pixel metropolis where every district reinforces a key pillar of digital citizenship: **Safety**, **Respect**, **Information**, **Balance**, and **Creativity**. Guided by the floating monitor mayor, **Modem Max**, kids collect badges in their **Backpack of Wisdom** by solving puzzles, untangling hilarious misunderstandings, and outsmarting the mischievous Glitches who twist good online habits into chaotic trouble.

The tone is lighthearted and kid-friendly, with over-the-top animations, expressive sprites, and slapstick reactions whenever the player steers toward a not-so-great choice. Each area is a miniature lesson wrapped in jokes, catchy jingles, and interactive problem-solving.

## Opening Scene
- The camera pans across a bustling 16-bit skyline before zooming into **Digital City Plaza**.
- Modem Max explains that Glitches have scrambled the city's good habits and pleads for help.
- The player receives the Backpack of Wisdom UI: four empty badge slots (Safety, Respect, Information, Balance) plus a shiny bonus slot for Creativity.
- A giant cursor encourages the player to click on the flashing districts to begin.

## Core Districts & Puzzles

### Safety District
**Setting:** Circuit-board sidewalks, blinking caution signs, and a password-powered fountain.

1. **Password Puzzle – "RoboBob's Brain Freeze"**  
   - RoboBob taped his password to his chest... again. Players drag letter, number, and symbol tiles into a password generator.  
   - Feedback gags: choosing "password123" makes RoboBob short-circuit, spraying confetti screws while muttering, "I *just* changed it yesterday!"  
   - Success criteria: 8+ characters, mix of types, no personal info.  
   - Teaching point: strong passwords protect accounts.

2. **Stranger Chat Café – "Who Let the Doge Out?"**  
   - A Glitch dressed as a fluffy dog tries to learn the player's name, school, and address.  
   - Dialogue tree offers safe responses ("I only share that with trusted adults!") vs. risky ones.  
   - Wrong picks trigger safe slapstick (the dog puff-smokes away, leaving a "TRY AGAIN" squeaky toy).  
   - Teaching point: keep personal info private.

3. **Pop-Up Arcade – "Attack of the Free Diamonds"**  
   - Scam windows bounce around promising "Totally Real Free Diamonds!!!"  
   - Players must click the "X" or drag them to the trash before timers run out, occasionally earning a "Report" power-up to vaporize them all.  
   - Teaching point: ignore suspicious offers and report scams.

### Respect Plaza
**Setting:** Marble statues of pixel pals, chat bubbles floating in the air, and a kindness fountain powered by compliments.

1. **Cyberbully Corner – "Chatroom Showdown"**  
   - Two pixel kids trade mean messages. Players pick dialogue options to steer toward empathy.  
   - Positive choices trigger confetti and happy sprites; negative choices summon a cackling Glitch who graffiti-tags the chat.  
   - Teaching point: words matter; stand up to bullying.

2. **Emoji Quest – "Operation Right-Face"**  
   - Match scrambled emoji meanings to their correct feelings.  
   - Mistakes cause emojis to zoom around like balloons with deflating noises.  
   - Teaching point: tone and context matter online.

3. **Compliment Catapult – "Praise Parade"**  
   - Launch compliments at glum townsfolk using a catapult.  
   - Each correct compliment lands with a "boing" and paints the plaza brighter.  
   - Teaching point: spread positivity to build respectful communities.

### Info Alley
**Setting:** Alleyway of neon newsstands, scrolling tickers, and suspiciously enthusiastic pigeons with press hats.

1. **Fact or Fake Stand – "Headline Hijinks"**  
   - Shady merchant hawks wild headlines like "Three-Headed Dogs Win Science Fair."  
   - Players investigate using magnifying glasses to check author, date, and sources.  
   - Correctly labeling stories triggers truth-beam spotlights that chase away Glitches.  
   - Teaching point: evaluate information for credibility.

2. **Ad Detective – "Spot the Sizzle"**  
   - A busy webpage hides ads among real content.  
   - Clicking an ad reveals goofy animations (dancing hot dogs, roller-skating toothbrushes) while the narrator laughs, "Yep, that's an ad!"  
   - Teaching point: recognize persuasive content.

3. **Library Link – "Homework Hero"**  
   - Compare two research sites: one trustworthy (librarian-run, proper citations), one nonsense (glowing text, no sources, "Sponsored by Glitches").  
   - Choosing correctly earns a "Research Ready" badge sticker in the backpack.  
   - Teaching point: use reliable sources.

### Copyright Court
**Setting:** Grand courtroom with vinyl record chandeliers and a judge's bench shaped like a boombox.

1. **Music Mix-Up – "DJ Glitch Gets Busted"**  
   - Remix beats by dragging loops into a track.  
   - Players must attach "credit tokens" to the original artists before playing the mix.  
   - Forgetting credit triggers the judge's gavels to boogie angrily: "Remix rights mean giving props!"  
   - Teaching point: respect creative ownership.

2. **Art Gallery Puzzle – "Signed, Sealed, Credited"**  
   - Walk through pixel paintings. Some plaques read "Artist: ???"  
   - Players fix plaques by selecting the correct artist or license info.  
   - Wrong answers cue Glitches doodling mustaches and googly eyes on masterpieces until fixed.  
   - Teaching point: give credit when you share or use others' work.

### Balance Park
**Setting:** Retro amusement park with glowing screens on one side and playgrounds on the other.

1. **Screen-Time Scales – "Seesaw of Schedules"**  
   - Drag activity icons (gaming, homework, sports, sleep, family time) onto a seesaw.  
   - Too many screens tip it, making the avatar nod off mid-click.  
   - Balanced selections trigger fireworks and cheering squirrels.  
   - Teaching point: balance online and offline time.

2. **Break Dance – "Stretch to the Beat"**  
   - Guide kids at a LAN party to stand, stretch, and sip water.  
   - Ignoring breaks causes the screen to blur and the music to slow comically.  
   - Teaching point: take healthy breaks during screen time.

3. **Family Quest – "Dinner Bell Dash"**  
   - Help characters log off in time for a family picnic.  
   - Success earns the Balance badge and a goofy dance montage.

## Finale: Digital Citizen Hall
- With every badge glowing, the player returns to City Hall for the victory sequence.  
- Modem Max crowns the player an **Official Digital Citizen** while remixed chiptune fireworks light up the skyline.  
- The reformed Glitches now chant, "Be Safe! Be Kind! Be Smart! Balance Time! Give Credit Every Time!"  
- A final screen invites kids to replay and discover alternate dialogue, easter eggs, and hidden jokes.

## Gameplay Loop & UI Highlights
- **Point-and-click navigation** with context-sensitive cursors (look, talk, use).  
- **Dialogue choices** always include at least one goofy option, one helpful option, and one obviously bad-but-funny choice, reinforcing consequences without punishment.
